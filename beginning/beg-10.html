            <p>You both look towards your apartment door where the call had come from. 
                Lucy’s ears flatten under your hand and you feel her turn the other way, 
                brushing up against your side before quickly slipping past you. 
                She’s headed for your room, probably to hide under the bed. 
                A part of you wishes you could follow her.  </p>
