                much as you can do before you
                 are pulled roughly past the 
                 doorframe. And then you’re in 
                 his arms, and your neck is pierced
                  by his fangs, and despite your 
                  weak struggles, despite your 
                  tearful cries, you are helpless.
                   And so he continues to take, 
                   and take, and take. 
                   Your vision grows black 
                   and your breathing slows, 
                   each breath a desperate fight.
                    Your head swims.</p>
